## About Me
🎓 BSc in Artificial Intelligence student at the Polytechnic University of Catalonia (UPC) (GPA: 8.83/10). I am currently an exchange student at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), focusing on advanced Deep Learning and Computer Vision.

🔬 As a Research Intern at the Computer Vision Center (CVC), I first-authored a research paper on a novel benchmark for Machine Unlearning in CLIP, which involved training large-scale models and engineering a synthetic dataset for sensitive data removal.

🏆 I thrive on practical, high-pressure challenges and have an award-winning track record in AI-focused hackathons. My academic work includes Honors for "Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning" and "Programming and Algorithms I".

💻 Core Expertise: Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning, and NLP.

🚀 I am passionate about building innovative AI solutions and am always looking for the next complex problem to solve.
